## About This Book Series

I wrote this series after years of struggling with the gap between theoretical tensor mathematics and practical, high-performance C implementations. Too many resources either focus on abstract concepts without addressing real-world implementation challenges, or they provide code snippets that fall apart in production environments.

This book series is different. It's the guide I wish I had when I started building tensor systems for embedded devices and HPC clusters. Each chapter tackles concrete problems you'll face when implementing tensor operations in C, with complete code examples that prioritize:

- **Hands-on learning**: Every concept is accompanied by working C code you can compile and run
- **Performance optimization**: Techniques for squeezing maximum performance from your hardware
- **Memory management**: Proper allocation, tracking, and freeing of resources
- **Debugging strategies**: Real-world approaches to finding and fixing common bugs
- **Production readiness**: Code that's robust enough for industrial applications

## Key Features

- **Problem-driven approach**: Each chapter solves specific challenges rather than presenting abstract theory
- **C-centric implementation**: All code uses manual memory management, pointers, and structsâ€”no hidden abstractions
- **Toolchain mastery**: Learn to use GDB, Valgrind, perf, and compiler flags as essential parts of your workflow
- **Bare-metal focus**: Designed for developers working on embedded systems, HPC, or custom ML runtimes
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with basic tensor structures and advance to neural networks and embedded deployment

## Who This Book Is For

This series is ideal for C programmers who need to implement high-performance numerical systems from scratch. You might be:

- An embedded systems developer implementing ML algorithms on resource-constrained hardware
- A performance engineer optimizing numerical code for HPC applications
- A machine learning practitioner who wants to understand what happens beneath high-level frameworks
- A computer science student looking to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation

Basic knowledge of C programming and linear algebra concepts is assumed, but each topic is explained from first principles with a focus on practical implementation.
