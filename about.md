# About This Book

"Tensor Programming in C: Building High-Performance Numerical Systems from Scratch" is a comprehensive guide to implementing tensor operations, optimizations, and real-world applications in C. The book takes readers from basic tensor structures to high-performance neural networks and embedded deployments.

## The Author

[Author Name] is a software engineer and numerical computing specialist with extensive experience in developing high-performance tensor libraries for a variety of platforms, from embedded systems to HPC clusters. 

With a background in both practical engineering and theoretical computer science, [Author Name] bridges the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and efficient, production-ready implementations.

## Key Features of This Book

This series is ideal for C programmers who need to implement high-performance numerical systems from scratch. You might be:

- An embedded systems developer implementing ML algorithms on resource-constrained hardware
- A performance engineer optimizing numerical code for HPC applications
- A machine learning practitioner who wants to understand what happens beneath high-level frameworks
- A computer science student looking to bridge the gap between theory and practical implementation

Basic knowledge of C programming and linear algebra concepts is assumed, but each topic is explained from first principles with a focus on practical implementation.
