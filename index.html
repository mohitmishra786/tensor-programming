    <h2>About This Book Series</h2>
    <p>I wrote this series after years of struggling with the gap between theoretical tensor mathematics and practical, high-performance C implementations. Too many resources either focus on abstract concepts without addressing real-world implementation challenges, or they provide code snippets that fall apart in production environments.</p>
    <p>This book series is different. It's the guide I wish I had when I started building tensor systems for embedded devices and HPC clusters. Each chapter tackles concrete problems you'll face when implementing tensor operations in C, with complete code examples that prioritize:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hands-on learning</strong>: Every concept is accompanied by working C code you can compile and run</li>
      <li><strong>Performance optimization</strong>: Techniques for squeezing maximum performance from your hardware</li>
      <li><strong>Memory management</strong>: Proper allocation, tracking, and freeing of resources</li>
      <li><strong>Debugging strategies</strong>: Real-world approaches to finding and fixing common bugs</li>
      <li><strong>Production readiness</strong>: Code that's robust enough for industrial applications</li>
    </ul>
